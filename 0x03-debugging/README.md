Debugging C code involves identifying and fixing errors, such as logical errors, syntax errors, or runtime errors, and here are some general steps you can follow to debug your C code: Read the error message carefully to understand the issue, including the line number and nature of the error; review the code line by line, checking for mistakes like missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses or brackets, misspelled variable names, or incorrect function calls; use printf statements to output variable values or progress messages, aiding in identifying unexpected behavior or values; divide and conquer complex sections by testing smaller parts individually to isolate and narrow down the problem; and finally, verify input and output, ensuring correct data types, proper handling of user input, and expected output results.
